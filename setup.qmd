This is the set-up page for the **R for Geospatial** workshop. You ***must*** complete all steps on this page before the first day of the workshop. If you have any issues, we will have set-up hours during the 30 minutes before the start of Day 1, or you can email ccmothes\@colostate.edu beforehand.

## Install R and RStudio

*Check R version required for all necessary packages !!!*

## Package Installation

While the R software comes with many pre-loaded functions (referred to as 'base R' functions), there are thousands of R packages that provide additional reusable R functions. In order to use these functions you need to first install the package to your local machine using the `install.packages()` function. Once a package is installed on your computer you don't need to install it again (but you may have to update it). Anytime you want to use the package in a new R session you can load it with the `library()` function.

The packages we are using for this workshop are listed below:
